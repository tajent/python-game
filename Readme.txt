After finishing 'Learn Python the Hard Way' https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/, I was given an assignment to build an application as described below. Due to publishing restrictions, it cannot be made public, so currently just making a README available.

System Requirements:
--------------------
Python 2.7


Description:
------------

The goal was to create an application to find out certain information
for specific routes on a local commuter railroad which services a
number of towns in Kiwiland.

Running the application:
------------------------
To use, run the following unix/linux command from the application root directory:
python journeys_info.py input.txt


Running the tests:
------------------
Input is tested using Unit Tests. To use, run the following unix/linux command from the application
root directory:
python -m unittest discover -v
